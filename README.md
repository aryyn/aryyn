My name is Arnald Ponsatí from Barcelona, I am an Electronic Engineer and did my final thesis about Blockchain Technology, more precisely I designed a cryptocurrency farm with renewable energies.
My studies are basically oriented to the industry, because I did a 2 years high degree about Automation and industrial robotics. After that I started a "Bachelor’s Degree in Automation and Industrial Electronic Engineering" which I finished on July 2021. I have knowledge about Phyton, Java , C++, C#, Matlab and deep knowledge on PLC programming. Currently I'm waiting to begin a short course about Blockchain programming.
During my studies I’ve been working in several jobs, some of them are: 
-Hostel receptionist in  Blackpool (Liverpool) for 6 months.
-Technical commercial in Cobex (Barcelona) for 6 months.
-Drone designer in Drone Flight (Barcelona) for 6 months.
-Small company dedicated to ceramic production, currently.
Since I finished my studies I’m looking for a new job related to what I want my career to be, blockchain.
